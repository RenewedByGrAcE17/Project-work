## Introduction
Northwind Traders faces a decline in profitability due to inefficiencies in product sales, customer management, and regional marketing strategies. This analysis identifies key drivers of underperformance and provides actionable recommendations to improve sales and operational efficiency.

* Products in Category X contributed less than 2% to revenue and showed a declining sales trend.
* Seasonal trends indicated potential for repositioning underperforming products.
### 2. Customer Value and Retention
